2. Src Port: 60092

3. A client needs the port number of a server so it can contact it. Ports make it so that multiple services can run on a single server 
and help direct the client's request to the appropriate service.

5. [SYN] and [ACK] are used to establish a TCP connection / three-way handshake: [SYN] is used to initiate the TCP connection and 
[ACK] is used to acknowledge the receipt of data

6. The [FIN] protocol is used to terminate the the connection between a client and a server. The daytime server initiated the the closing of the TCP connection
since they are the source ip and nc client was the destinition and the [FIN] protocol was used.

===== HTTP =====

1. Since there were four [FIN, ACK] protocols used this tells us that two TCP connections were opened and closed. Since each TCP connection funs with a pair of
[FIN, ACK] to be closed, from client to server and server to client, this means that two connections need two pairs of these so a total of 4 were used.

2. I believe it was in line 28 because the 'GET' function was used to request the HTTP showing 'GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\n'


3. I believe it was in line 447 where it reads 'JPEG JFIF image' and it reads the contents of the image.
